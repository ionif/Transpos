Transpos recognizes images and displays a 3D model centered on the image's plane. Downloads/Updates both reference images and 3D models from Firebase upon startup. This allows recognizing and displaying different objects without updating the app itself but rather updating the database.

based on [Apple's ARKit image recognition example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/detecting_images_in_an_ar_experience)
