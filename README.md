# Transpos
made by Alex Ionkov and Jas Bakshi

Transpos recognizes images and displays a 3D model centered on the image's plane. Gets both reference images and 3D models from Firebase which allows recognizing different objects without updating the app itself but rather updating the database.

based on [Apple's ARKit image recognition example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/detecting_images_in_an_ar_experience)
